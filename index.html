    <p>RFC Capital Partners Fund 3, LLC ("RFC") is the most current fund (circa 2020) in the 36-year history of RFC
        Capital Partners.</p>
    <p>RFC provides both advisory (investment banking and corporate strategy) and makes capital investments in a wide
        range of operating companies. RFC has provided advisory services to some of the largest corporate clients (e.g.,
        McKesson Corporation), private equity firms (e.g., Bain Capital) as well earlier stage ventures (e.g., Splash
        Beverages, Masters Pharmaceuticals).</p>
    <p>RFC invests in companies ranging from “start-ups” (e.g., CartPilot, Impress3D Dental, Arfona Printing, Splash
        Beverages, Stolen Beverages, STOR), to “roll-ups” (e.g., Konfidents Dental, Germany), “corporate carveouts”
        (e.g., Bioniche, Unisource), “management buyouts” (e.g., Bolt-Tech) and leveraged buyouts (e.g., Coachman
        Industries, Coe Manufacturing, Masters Pharmaceuticals) where there is "transitional" opportunity to increase
        shareholder value.</p>
    <p>In addition to our own funds, we partner with private equity investors (e.g., Bain Capital, Altor, HIG,
        RoundTable, etc.) to sponsor investments in companies of virtually any size and in a broad range of industries
        and geographic locations.</p>

        <li>Partner buy-outs or succession planning strategies.</li>
        <li>Division or product line spin-offs from public or private companies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a result we seek companies where we can:</p>

        <li>Pursue significant top-line growth.</li>
        <li>Increase profitability through operational improvements.</li>
        <li>Enhance managerial and board expertise.</li>
